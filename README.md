# Staycation's Technical Test

Welcome! This technical test aims to validate a few basic programming skills before we go further.

The goal is to reproduce a light version of Staycation's homepage package wall.
Some of the questions are independant, some others are sequentially dependant.

Remember that the goal is not necessarily to answer all the questions, but to go far enough to show the range of your talents ;)
Improvisation is welcome, as long as it demonstrates your ability to build great apps with us!

## Launch the apps

- The PostgreSQL database using `docker-compose up -V`
- The front app using `cd client; yarn dev`
- The backend app using `cd server; yarn start`

## GOAL ! üèÅÔ∏è

 - [x] Fetch hotels so it matches the hotel model described below
 - [x] Display hotel cards as shown in the figure below
 - [x] Top bar should be static while scrolling. Implement it
 - [x] We want the Staycation logo to be centered in the top bar, as shown in the figure below. Implement it.
 - [x] Display the aggregated review count & score for each package card
 - [x]  Display the last availability on every package price. See availability definition below
 - [ ] . ~~Take bookings into account to compute remaining stockIf a package is not available on the current sale date,~~ fetch its lowest opening price on the most recent sale date it has availabilites on (careful, it's a windowed lookup ;)). ~~Display these availabilities in grey on the package card.~~
 - [x] (no code) How would you implement a caching strategy for this app?
